# CiliaFreqMap
ImageJ / Fiji macro to extract &amp; measure moving structures (Cilia) from timelapse images. Uses a Fourier transform to measure dominant beating frequencies. Outputs a movie of extracted moving structures and a frequency map showing the regions of the image with beating cilia. The image is colour coded to show the beating frequency of every pixel.
