ImageJ / Fiji macro to extract &amp; measure moving structures (Cilia) from timelapse images. Uses a Fourier transform to measure dominant beating frequencies. Outputs a movie of extracted moving structures and a frequency map showing the regions of the image with beating cilia. The image is colour coded to show the beating frequency of every pixel. 

Developed with test files from Vanesa Papastavrou [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanesa-papastavrou-5264ba152/?originalSubdomain=gr) from the Mitchison lab.
Thanks for the inspiration to develop this script and for the running the protoypes on your files.

Work in progress, this will be regularly updated with improvements to the first published version (v210).

Additional macros will also be added to rapidly inspect timelapse images at a specified pixel or region of interest.
